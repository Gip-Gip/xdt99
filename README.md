xdt99: TI 99 Cross-Development Tools
====================================

The **TI 99 Cross-Development Tools** (xdt99) are a small suite of programs that
facilitate the development of programs for the TI 99 family of home computers on
modern computer systems:

 * `xas99`: A TMS9900 cross-assembler
 * `xga99`: A GPL cross-assembler
 * `xbas99`: A TI BASIC and TI Extended BASIC lister and encoder
 * `xdm99`: A disk manager for sector-based TI disk images
 * `xvm99`: A volume manager for nanoPEB/CF7A Compact Flash cards
 * `xdt99-mode`: A major mode for the GNU Emacs text editor
 * `xdt99 IDEA`: A plugin for the IntelliJ IDEA development environment

The `xas99` cross-assembler supports all documented TMS9900 opcodes and should
assemble any existing assembly code for the TI 99 without modification.  Object
code generated by `xas99` is identical to compressed or uncompressed object code
produced by the original TI Editor/Assembler package.  Modern extensions such as
local labels and macro support simplify the writing of assembly programs on
modern hardware.  The F18A GPU instruction set is also supported.

The `xga99` GPL cross-assembler generates GROM image files for TI's proprietary
Graphics Programming Language (GPL).  The GPL assembler is a quick way to
translate self-written GPL programs into RPK cartridge files that can be run
with the MESS emulator.

The `xbas99` BASIC tool encodes TI BASIC and TI Extended BASIC programs into
their internal format that can be loaded by the BASIC interpreter using
the `OLD` command.  Conversely, the tool also lists BASIC program files
similarly to the `LIST` command. 

The `xdm99` disk manager works with sector-based TI disk images used by most
emulators, including MESS.  `xdm99` also supports disk-less files in TIFiles and
V9T9 format.  The `xvm99` volume manager extends the `xdm99` functionality to CF
cards used by the nanoPEB/CF7A devices.

The `xdt99-mode` and `xdt99 IDEA` plugins provide editor support for writing
assembly and TI Extended BASIC programs using the GNU Emacs and the IntelliJ
IDEA development environments, respectively.  Plugin features include syntax
highlighting, navigation, and semantic renaming, among others.

For additional information, please refer to the [xdt99 homepage][1] or the
[xdt99 manual][4].  Windows users unfamiliar with working with the command line
will find some platform-specific information in the [Windows tutorial][5].

**Latest version: 1.5.3**

The latest binary distribution of xdt99 is available on the project
[releases page][2] on GitHub.  xdt99 requires [Python 2.7.x][6] and runs on any
platform that Python supports, including Linux, Windows, and OS X.

xdt99 is released under the GNU GPLv2.  All sources are available on
[GitHub][3].


Download and Installation
-------------------------

Download the latest [binary release][2] from GitHub.  Alternatively, clone the
entire xdt99 GitHub [repository][3].

All tools -- `xas99` cross-assembler, `xga99` GPL cross-assembler, `xbas99`
BASIC tool, `xdm99` disk manager, and `xvm99` volume manager -- are standalone
self-contained Python programs (but `xvm99` requires `xdm99`).  Simply place the
files `xas99.py`, `xga99.py`, `xbas99.py`, `xdm99.py`, and `xvm99.py` somewhere
into your `$PATH` or wherever your Python installation will find them.

The `xdt99-mode` and `xdt99 IDEA` plugins provide editor support and may be used
independently of the other xdt99 tools.  Likewise, `xas99` and others may be
used without these plugins.

First-time xdt99 users running Windows will find additional information about
installation and some tips on getting started in the [Windows tutorial][5].
Users of other platforms who are unfamiliar with the command line may also find
some tips in there.

`<device>` is the platform-specific name of the Compact Flash card drive, e.g.,
`/dev/sd<X>` on Linux, `/dev/Disk<X>` on Mac OS X, or `\\.\PHYSICALDRIVE<X>` on
Windows.

`<volumes>` is a single value or a combination of values and ranges, e.g.,
`1,3-4,6-10`.  If more than one volume is supplied, the same command is applied
to *all* volumes.

Additionally, `xvm99` extends most of the functionality of `xdm99` to disk
volumes.
