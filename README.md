xdt99: TI 99 Cross-Development Tools
====================================

The **TI 99 Cross-Development Tools** (xdt99) are a small suite of programs that
facilitate the development of programs for the TI 99 family of home computers on
modern computer systems:

 * `xas99`: A TMS9900 cross-assembler

 * `xdm99`: A command-line disk manager for sector-based TI disk images

The `xas99` cross-assembler supports all documented TMS9900 opcodes and should
assemble any existing assembly code for the TI 99 without modification.  The
object code generated by `xas99` is identical to uncompressed object code
produced by the original TI Editor/Assembler package.

The `xdm99` disk manager works with sector-based TI disk images used by most
emulators, including MESS.  `xdm99` also supports the TIFiles file format.

For additional information, please refer to the [xdt99 homepage][1].

**Latest version: 1.0.0**

The latest binary distribution of xdt99 is available on the project
[releases page][2] on GitHub.  xdt99 requires [Python 2.7.x][4] and runs on any
platform that Python supports, including Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.

xdt99 is released under the GNU GPLv2.  All sources are available on
[GitHub][3].


Download and Installation
-------------------------

Download the latest [binary release][2] from GitHub.  Alternatively, clone the
entire xdt99 GitHub [repository][3].

Both `xas99` cross-assembler and `xdm99` disk manager are self-contained Python
programs.  Simply place the files `xas99.py` and `xdm99.py` somewhere into your
`$PATH` or whereever your Python installation will find them.


Basic Usage: `xas99`
--------------------

This is just a brief overview of the most common usages for `xas99`.  For
detailed information, please refer to the [xdt99 homepage][1] or the manual
included with xdt99.

Generate object code for the Editor/Assembler module, option 3:

	$ xas99.py <source file>

Generate program image for the Editor/Assembler module, option 5:

	$ xas99.py -i <source file>

Generate cartridge file for the MESS emulator (experimental):

	$ xas99.py -c <source file>

For a complete overview of the available command-line options, see `xas99.py
-h`.


Basic Usage: `xdm99`
--------------------

This is just a brief overview of the most common usages for `xdm99`.  For
detailed information, please refer to the [xdt99 homepage][1] or the manual
included with xdt99.

Print disk catalog on screen:

	$ xdm99.py <disk image>

Extract one or more files from disk image to local file system:

	$ xdm99.py <disk image> -e <file> ...

Extract files in TIFiles format:

	$ xdm99.py <disk image> -t -e <file> ...

Print file contents to screen:

	$ xdm99.py <disk image> -p <file> ...

Add local file to disk image:

	$ xdm99.py <disk image> -a <file> ... [-f <format>] [-n <name>]

Delete file on disk image:

	$ xdm99.py <disk image> -d <file> ...

Convert from TIFiles file to plain file:

	$ xdm99.py -F <TIFiles file>

Convert to TIFiles file from plain file:

	$ xdm99.py -T <plain file> [-f <format>] [-n <name>]

Print contents of TIFiles file:

	$ xdm99.py -P <TIFiles file>

Repair disk image with corrupt files or other inconsistencies:

	$ xdm99.py -R <disk image>

Print sector dump:

	$ xdm99.py work.dsk -s <number>

For a complete overview of the available command-line options, see `xdm99.py
-h`.
