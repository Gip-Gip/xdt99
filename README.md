xdt99: TI 99 Cross-Development Tools
====================================

The **TI 99 Cross-Development Tools** (xdt99) are a small suite of programs that
facilitate the development of programs for the TI 99 family of home computers on
modern computer systems:

 * `xas99`: A TMS9900 cross-assembler
 * `xga99`: A GPL cross-assembler
 * `xbas99`: A TI BASIC and TI Extended BASIC lister and encoder
 * `xdm99`: A command-line disk manager for sector-based TI disk images
 * `xvm99`: A command-line volume manager for nanoPEB/CF7A Compact Flash cards

The `xas99` cross-assembler supports all documented TMS9900 opcodes and should
assemble any existing assembly code for the TI 99 without modification.  The
object code generated by `xas99` is identical to compressed or uncompressed
object code produced by the original TI Editor/Assembler package.

The `xga99` GPL cross-assembler generates GROM image files for TI's proprietary
Graphics Programming Language (GPL).  The GPL assembler is a quick way to
translate self-written GPL programs into RPK cartridge files that can be run
with the MESS emulator.

The `xbas99` BASIC tool encodes TI BASIC and TI Extended BASIC programs into
their internal format that can be loaded by the BASIC interpreter using
the `OLD` command.  Conversely, the tool also lists BASIC program files
similarly to the `LIST` command. 

The `xdm99` disk manager works with sector-based TI disk images used by most
emulators, including MESS.  `xdm99` also supports the TIFiles file format.  The
`xvm99` volume manager extends the `xdm99` functionality to CF cards used by the
nanoPEB/CF7A devices.

For additional information, please refer to the [xdt99 homepage][1].

**Latest version: 1.5.x**

The latest binary distribution of xdt99 is available on the project
[releases page][2] on GitHub.  xdt99 requires [Python 2.7.x][5] and runs on any
platform that Python supports, including Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.

xdt99 is released under the GNU GPLv2.  All sources are available on
[GitHub][3].


Download and Installation
-------------------------

Download the latest [binary release][2] from GitHub.  Alternatively, clone the
entire xdt99 GitHub [repository][3].

All tools -- `xas99` cross-assembler, `xga99` GPL cross-assembler, `xbas99`
BASIC tool, `xdm99` disk manager, and `xvm99` volume manager -- are standalone
self-contained Python programs (but `xvm99` requires `xdm99`).  Simply place
the files `xas99.py`, `xdm99.py`, and `xvm99.py` somewhere into your `$PATH` or
whereever your Python installation will find them.


Basic Usage: `xas99`
--------------------

This is just a brief overview of the most common usages for `xas99`.  For

`xas99` supports various language extensions to the original Editor/Assembler
module:

 * Relaxed syntax (labels, comments, whitespace, case insensitivity, ...)
 * Improved expressions (Boolean operators, binary numbers, parentheses, ...)
 * Label continuations and local labels (`! dec r0; jne -!`)
 * New directive (`IBYTE` for binary includes)
 * Conditional assembly (`.ifdef`, ...)
 * Macros (`.defm`)

Please refer to the [xdt99 manual][4] for a detailed description of these
features.

Show information about volumes:

Write disk image to volumes:

    $ xvm99.py <device> <volumes> -w <disk image> [--keep-size]

`<device>` is the platform-specific name of the Compact Flash card drive, e.g.,
`/dev/sd<X>` on Linux, `/dev/Disk<X>` on Mac OS X, or `\\.\PHYSICALDRIVE<X>` on
Windows.

`<volumes>` is a single value or a combination of values and ranges, e.g.,
`1,3-4,6-10`.  If more than one volume is supplied, the same command is applied
to *all* volumes.

Additionally, `xvm99` extends most of the functionality of `xdm99` to disk
volumes.

Print disk catalog of one or more volumes:

    $ xvm99.py <device> <volumes> -i
